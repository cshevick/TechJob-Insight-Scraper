Tech Buddy
This project scrapes recent articles from TechCrunch and job postings from a GitHub repository, then summarizes and organizes the data into a split-screen HTML file. The HTML file displays the latest TechCrunch articles with summaries on one side, and the most recent job postings on the other.

Features
TechCrunch Article Scraping: Retrieves and summarizes the latest articles from TechCrunch.
GitHub Job Scraping: Extracts job postings, including company name, job title, location, and application links.
Summarization: Uses a pre-trained NLP model to summarize lengthy article content.
HTML Output: Generates an HTML file with a split-screen layout, displaying articles on one side and job listings on the other.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
BeautifulSoup4: For HTML parsing.
Requests: For sending HTTP requests to TechCrunch and GitHub.
Transformers (Hugging Face): For text summarization using the BART model.
Torch: Required by Transformers for the summarization model.
You can install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests transformers torch
File Structure
main.py: Main script to scrape, summarize, and generate the HTML file.
GithubScraper.py: Separate module to handle GitHub job scraping.
techcrunch_news.html: Output file generated by main.py, displaying both articles and job information.
Usage
1. Run the Main Script
The main script main.py will:

Scrape the latest articles from TechCrunch.
Summarize each article using the BART model.
Fetch job postings from a GitHub repository of internships.
Generate an HTML file displaying both articles and job postings.
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
2. Output
Upon completion, the script creates an techcrunch_news.html file with a split-screen layout:

Left Column: Contains the latest TechCrunch articles and their summaries.
Right Column: Displays recent job postings, including company name, job title, location, and an "Apply" hyperlink.
Code Structure
main.py
scrape_and_summarize_techcrunch_articles: Main function that coordinates article scraping, summarization, and HTML generation.
get_article_content: Extracts main content from an article URL.
summarize_long_text: Summarizes lengthy text by splitting it into chunks.
split_text: Splits long articles into smaller chunks for summarization.
GithubScraper.py
get_job_info: Scrapes job listings from the GitHub repository. Returns a list of dictionaries containing company name, job title, location, and link to apply.
Example HTML Output
After running the script, your techcrunch_news.html file will have a split layout, with TechCrunch articles and their summaries on one side, and job postings with "Apply" links on the other.

Troubleshooting
Rate Limiting: Some websites may block requests due to rate limits. Adding headers or introducing delays can help.
HTML Structure Changes: If either TechCrunch or GitHub changes its HTML structure, the parsing methods may need adjustment.
Future Improvements
Pagination: Add pagination to scrape more articles or jobs.
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling and retries for failed requests.
Customization: Allow user input for customizing the number of articles or jobs to scrape.
